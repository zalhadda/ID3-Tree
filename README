Implements an ID3 binary decision tree for the Titanic Machine Learning Disaster dataset.

The program can be run with:
  python3 ID3.py <path_to_train> <path_to_test> <decision_tree_type> <decision_tree_arguments>
  
There are four types of decision trees:
  (1) Vanilla ('vanilla'): [training_set_percentage]
  (2) Maximum Depth ('depth'): [training_set_percentage] [validation_set_percentage] [maximum_depth]
  (3) Minimum Split ('min_split'): [training_set_percentage] [validation_set_percentage] [minimum_splits]
  (4) Pruned ('prune'): [training_set_percentage] [validation_set_percentage]
